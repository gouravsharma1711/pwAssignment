//Q4: describe the usage of comma opertor in js and provide an example

// Answer 
/*

Usage of the Comma Operator in JavaScript
The comma operator (,) in JavaScript evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand. This operator is typically used in
situations where multiple expressions need to be evaluated, but only the result of the last expression is needed.

# Key Points :- 
1) Evaluates Multiple Expressions: The comma operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated in a single statement.
2) Returns the Last Expression: The result of the entire comma expression is the value of the last expression.
# Common Usage Scenarios
  ## For Loop:
It can be used to include multiple expressions in the initialization or increment section of a for loop.
 ##Side Effects:
To execute multiple expressions where the side effects of the earlier expressions are needed but only the result of the last expression is used.

*/
// Example 1: Using comma operator in a general context
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let result = (a += 1, b += 2, a + b);  // Evaluates a += 1, b += 2, then a + b

console.log(result);  // Output: 33
// Explanation: a becomes 11, b becomes 22, then result is 11 + 22 = 33

// Example 2: Using comma operator in a for loop
for (let i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++, j--) {
    console.log(`i: ${i}, j: ${j}`);
